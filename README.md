## Overview
---

A simple tic tac toe game.  Player's turn is indicated by small square on the top right.  Blue goes first, purple second.  When a player wins, all tiles will change to that player's color and a win indicator block will appear in the top left.  A tie will result in a grey box.  You can reset the game with the reset button on the top right, and reset the win count with the reset button at the top left.
